# MS-Course-Project---Olympic Games-Statistical-Insights-using-Machine-Learning

 This project Olympic Games Statistical Insights using Machine Learning is divided into two main phases:

### Phase 1: Statistical Data Analysis on the Olympics

In this initial phase, I conducted a detailed statistical analysis of Olympic data, presenting the findings through a user-friendly web application. The development of this application was facilitated using PyCharm as the primary development environment. To enhance the visual representation and interpretability of the data, I incorporated Seaborn and Plotly libraries. These tools not only contribute to a more engaging analysis but also ensure the accessibility of insights for a broader audience.

athlete_events.csv and noc_regions.csv is the 120 years of olympic dataset.The cleaned_medal_data.csv is the cleaned dataset after merging the two raw dataset, cleaning it by dropping all the inaccuracies, missing values and duplicates. Olympics_analysis.ipynb file is used for statistical analysis as well as creating web application.

 oapp.py is the main Python file for the PyCharm project that initializes streamlit app and defines the main functionality of the web application.While preprocess.py and help.py are supporting files and is imported to oapp.py to contribute to the overall functionality of the web application.

### Phase 2: Comparative Performance of Machine Learning Models predicting the Medal Distribution Accuracy(Jupyter Notebook)

 I have used two models to compare their performance predicting the Medal Distribution Accuracy. The two models are Random Forest Classifier(Olympic_prediction_randomforest_classifier.ipynb) and Support Vector Machine(Olympic_medal_SVM,ipynb).
